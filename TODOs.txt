- Benchmark removing index shifts
- Use consistent hashing algo for rehashing
- Benchmark flattening the LLHS elementArrays with cur impl
- Remove mod and divs on cache lookups by using upper and lower bits
- Profile starting elementIndices as byte[], then short[]
- Throw NPEs rather than checking parameters to add and remove
- addIndexFor should perform an inplace rehash rather than making this a later call.
- Combine indexOf loops for containsAll
