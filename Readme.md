Java implementations of some useful general purpose utilities:

 - LinkedArrayHashSet - A data structure combining the java.util List and Set interfaces using an indexed unrolled linked list.
 - Geometric Random - An extremely fast generator of random numbers from a geometric series. Very useful when implementing a high performance CSL.
