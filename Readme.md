Java implementations of some useful general purpose components and utilities. This is a work in progress and may contain bugs.

Highlights:

 - IntSkipList - Sorted collection of ints
 - Tuples - Primitive specialised versions of tuples using java records
 - DoubleVector and FloatVector - Useful vector functions such as MSE, dot product, and simhashing
 - NearestVectorStore - Provides approximate nearest neighbour search for related FloatVectors
 - DoubleArrayIterator - An array iterator that does not unbox its operands
 - FileIO - Fast mapping from files to bytes
